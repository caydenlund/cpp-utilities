# `pcre`: A PCRE2-compatible regular expression engine ![Status: in progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In_progress-yellow?style=flat&labelColor=%232c3e50&color=%23f39c12)

The C++ STL's regular expression engine is the worst.
It's slow. It's cumbersome. It doesn't have all the features I want.
I want to implement a fully-featured, efficient, robust regular expression library.
